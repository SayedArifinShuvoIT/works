Redirect or Rewrite:
You can change a URL with .htaccess directives in a couple of ways — the Redirect command and the mod_rewrite engine. The Redirect command tells the browser which other URL it should be looking out for. The mod_rewrite tool will normally “translate” the URL that’s in the request. Turns it into something the file system or CMS can understand. Then, it treats the request as though the translated URL was the one that was requested.

From the perspective of the web browser it’s business as usual. It gets the content it requested and carries on as if nothing happened.

The mod_rewrite tool is also able to produce 301 redirects that work like the Redirect command. But with a greater number of possible rules instead. Including elaborate pattern matching and rewriting instructions – which is beyond what Redirect can do.
